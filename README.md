# Data Analysis Learning Journey

Welcome!  
This repository documents my learning journey as I study **Python for Data Analysis**.  
It contains topic-wise **notes**, **code snippets**, and **practical examples** designed to build a strong foundation in data manipulation, numerical computing, and data science.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- **NumPy for Data Analysis**
- **Pandas - Series for Data Analysis**

(Upcoming topics: pandas Series)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Develop strong Python skills for data analysis
- Gain hands-on experience with core libraries (NumPy, pandas, etc.)
- Create a resource for revision and community sharing
- Connect and learn from the broader data science community
## ðŸ“Œ How to Use

- Browse through the notes and code examples.
- Run the notebooks locally to practice and experiment.

Feel free to fork, clone, or suggest improvements! ðŸš€
